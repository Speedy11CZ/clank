![Clank Logo](clank-logo.png)

Clank is a high-performance and Open Source implementation of the
proprietary SCE-RT Medius server stack used in many PlayStation 2
and PlayStation 3 multiplayer titles. The project was originally
intended for *Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal* for the
[UYA Online](https://uyaonline.com/) project. However we decided
to redesign it to work with many other Medius titles as well.

Our server aims to be feature rich, modular, stable, and **fast**.

Currently this server supports emulating Medius v1.5 - v1.8, however we plan on
adding support for Medius v1.9 and v1.10 (2.10) soon.

## Game titles tested so far
The table below shows game titles that have been tested with Clank.
The focus of the table below is based on a title's ability to get from login to getting in a game world.
- **SUCCESS** = Able to get past MAS into MLS, create a game world on DME(P2S2P) or MAS(P2P) and be active in the game world.
- **PARTIAL** = Able to get past MAS into MLS.
- **INCOMPLETE** = Missing components or planned features to get past MAS.
- **UNKNOWN** = The title cannot be tested at the moment. See the description column for more info.

## Building and Running Clank

### Build Clank
Ensure you have the JDK 8+ and Maven installed first.

Note: any changes to the `src/main/proto/` files will require the protocol buffers
to be recompiled, this can easily be run by running `./compile-protobufs.sh` on Linux
or `compile-protobufs.bat` on Windows. Running either `build.sh` or `build.bat` automatically
invokes the protobuf to be recompiled.

#### Linux
1. Run `./build.sh`.

#### Windows
1. Run `build.bat`.

#### Docker
1. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for more info.


### Run Clank
In order to run Clank you will need to create a JSON configuration file, there are
"example" configuration files located in `config/`, that can be used as a starting
place. For example, make a copy of `config/mas.json.example` named `config/mas.json`.

You can then use `./launch.sh config/mas.json` on Linux, or `build.bat config\mas.json`, to run a Clank MAS server.

#### Linux
1. Copy the example configuration file `config/mas.json.example` -> `config/mas.json`.
2. Run `./launch.sh config/mas.json`.

#### Windows
1. Copy the example configuration file `config\mas.json.example` -> `config\mas.json`.
2. Run `launch.bat config\mas.json`.


## Clank components

![Clank Diagram](clank-diagram.png)

This server supports emulating the following components:
- The **MUIS (Medius Universe Information Server)** is the entrypoint for several
  games that may have "multiverses", this is generally used before MAS. This server
  will reply with an `ip address` to a MAS server. This server is also sometimes
  used for P2P (peer-to-peer) games.
- The **MAS (Medius Authentication Server)** is where players initially login using
  an existing profile and get a `session token` and `ip address` that is then
  used to login to the MLS.
- The **MLS (Medius Lobby Server)** is where a majority of players reside when they
  are not in the game world, chatting, looking for a game, managing clans, adding
  buddies, or looking at stats.
- The **NAT Server (Network Address Translation)** is a server generally used for
  P2P games, however it is seen used in CS (client/server) titles to return
  the client's public IP address to themselves.
- The **DME Server (Distributed Memory Engine)** is the game server, responsible
  for hosting CS (client/server) games. This is generally used in the "staging"
  and "in game" modes in most titles.

You can read more about these components [here](https://wiki.hashsploit.net/PlayStation_2#Medius).


## Configuration
See [config/README.md](config/README.md) for more info.


## Console commands
Each component of Clank has different built-in commands as
they differ per context and implementation, however you can
always use the `help` command to view all commands available in
the current component being run. Some commands have
`[optional]` and or `<required>` parameters.

For *all* servers:
- `exit` - Shutdown the server emulator.
- `help [command]` - Show all commands, or show information about a specific command.
- `version` - Show the current version of the server emulator.

For *MAS*, *MLS* and *MUIS* servers:
- `broadcast <severity> <message>` - Broadcast a message to all the players connected.


## Lua plugin API
You can read more about the Clank Lua plugin API in the [clank-plugins](https://github.com/hashsploit/clank-plugins) repo.


## About the SCE-RT / RTIME / Medius Protocol
SCE-RT is the underlying protocol of Medius titles for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3.
SCE-RT was developed by the acquisition of RTIME Inc. by Sony Computer Entertainment
America for their underlying game networking engine for PlayStation 2 games.

RTIME (1997):
